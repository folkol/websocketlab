How?

java -cp EchoServer/bin/ EchoServer

WebSockets lab
==============

Works (By accepting, reading a payload, sending back the reversed payload and closing).
No support for anything else than a non extended, non fragmented, text frames atm. (Chrome works, Safari do not)

Handshake:

From client:

  1.   An HTTP/1.1 or higher GET request, including a "Request-URI"
        [RFC2616] that should be interpreted as a /resource name/
        defined in Section 3 (or an absolute HTTP/HTTPS URI containing
        the /resource name/).

   2.   A |Host| header field containing the server's authority.

   3.   An |Upgrade| header field containing the value "websocket",
        treated as an ASCII case-insensitive value.

   4.   A |Connection| header field that includes the token "Upgrade",
        treated as an ASCII case-insensitive value.

   5.   A |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header field with a base64-encoded (see
        Section 4 of [RFC4648]) value that, when decoded, is 16 bytes in
        length.

   6.   A |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field, with a value of 13.

   7.   Optionally, an |Origin| header field.  This header field is sent
        by all browser clients.  A connection attempt lacking this
        header field SHOULD NOT be interpreted as coming from a browser
        client.

   8.   Optionally, a |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field, with a list
        of values indicating which protocols the client would like to
        speak, ordered by preference.

   9.   Optionally, a |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field, with a
        list of values indicating which extensions the client would like
        to speak.  The interpretation of this header field is discussed
        in Section 9.1.

   10.  Optionally, other header fields, such as those used to send
        cookies or request authentication to a server.  Unknown header
        fields are ignored, as per [RFC2616].
